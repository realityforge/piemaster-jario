 	1. INTRODUCTION
   -----------------
 	
 	Jario is a simple platformer game, essentially a Mario clone, written in Java using the Slick
 game library (http://slick.cokeandcode.com/) and the Artemis entity system framework
 (http://gamadu.com/artemis/).
 
 	More than anything else, Jario is a proof of technology, an exploration of the practicality of
 applying the Artemis framework to a platformer game. It's not being developed as a serious game,
 but Artemis has shown a great deal of promise, and so I'll continue implementing features as I get
 to them (for practice and future re-use).

 	2. HOW TO PLAY
   ----------------
 
 	As all the Mario games since forever, the player can run left and right, jump, and occasionally
 shoot fireballs. Jumping on enemies tends to hurt them, and jumping into item boxes from below will
 pop items out of them.
 
 ← & →		- Move
 SPACEBAR 	- Jump
 F			- Shoot
 SHIFT		- Sprint
 CTRL		- Walk
 ESCAPE		- Menu/Exit
 ENTER		- Player
 
 F1			- Debug display
 I			- Temporary invulnerability
 
 
 	3. TODO
   ---------
 	
 - Add breakable blocks
 - Add semi-passable blocks
 - Add moving blocks
 - Add more level geometry
 - Add high scores
 - [Add invulnerability stars]
 - Add [level end], more levels and transitions
 - Add more efficient (paged) level scrolling, enemy suspension
 - Implement some kind of collision memory for greater accuracy
 - Fix reset/add New Game option
 - So much else...
